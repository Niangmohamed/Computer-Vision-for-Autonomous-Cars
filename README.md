# Computer Vision for Autonomous Cars

## Introduction

<p align='justify'> In order to put the project in its overall context and understand some important and necessary notions about autonomous cars, you must do some research and answer the following questions: </p>

* What is an **autonomous cars** ? What are the different **levels of autonomy** ?

* What is a **connected cars** ?

* What are the **existing systems** ? 

* What are the **algorithms**, **approaches** and **libraries** used actually ?

### What is an autonomous car ? What are the different levels of autonomy ?

<p align='justify'> We can distinguish 6 levels of autonomy. </p>

| Level 0  | No Automation          |
| Level 1  | Driver Assistance      |
| Level 2  | Partial Automation     |
| Level 3  | Conditional Automation |
| Level 4  | High Automation        |
| Level 5  | Complete Automation    |
