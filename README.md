# Computer Vision for Autonomous Cars

## Introduction

<p align='justify'> In order to put the project in its overall context and understand some important and necessary notions about autonomous cars, you must do some research and answer the following questions: </p>

* What is an **autonomous cars** ? What are the different **levels of autonomy** ?

* What is a **connected cars** ?

* What are the **existing systems** ? 

* What are the **algorithms**, **approaches** and **libraries** used actually ?

### What is an autonomous car ? What are the different levels of autonomy ?

<p align='justify'> We can distinguish 6 levels of autonomy. </p>

| Level 0  | No Automation          |
| :------- | :--------------------- |
| Level 1  | Driver Assistance      |
| Level 2  | Partial Automation     |
| Level 3  | Conditional Automation |
| Level 4  | High Automation        |
| Level 5  | Complete Automation    |

**Level 0: No Automation**

<p align='justify'> The driving is entirely the responsibility of the driver who may have warning mechanisms such as the sound signal when crossing line. </p>

**Level 1 : Driver Assistance**

<p align='justify'> The driver is always responsible for the maneuvers, but delegates some of the tasks to the system. He must be able to fully regain control over driving if the situation requires it. </p>
