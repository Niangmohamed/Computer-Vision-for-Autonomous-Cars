# Computer Vision for Autonomous Cars

## Introduction

<p align='justify'> In order to put the project in its overall context and understand some important and necessary notions about autonomous cars, you must do some research and answer the following questions: </p>

* What is an **autonomous cars** ? What are the different **levels of autonomy** ?

* What is a **connected cars** ?

* What are the **existing systems** ? 

* What are the **algorithms**, **approaches** and **libraries** used actually ?

### What is an autonomous car ? What are the different levels of autonomy ?

<p align='justify'> We can distinguish 6 levels of autonomy. </p>

| Level 0  | No Automation          |
| :------- | :--------------------- |
| Level 1  | Driver Assistance      |
| Level 2  | Partial Automation     |
| Level 3  | Conditional Automation |
| Level 4  | High Automation        |
| Level 5  | Complete Automation    |

**Level 0: No Automation**

<p align='justify'> The driving is entirely the responsibility of the driver who may have warning mechanisms such as the sound signal when crossing line. </p>

**Level 1 : Driver Assistance**

<p align='justify'> The driver is always responsible for the maneuvers, but delegates some of the tasks to the system. He must be able to fully regain control over driving if the situation requires it. </p>

**Level 2 : Partial Automation**

<p align='justify'> The responsibility for the maneuvers is entirely delegated to the system, but everything is done under constant supervision of the driver, who can decide to take back the hand at any time, for example during an automatic lane change or parking assistance which is activated only when a parking space is detected or selected by the driver. </p>

**Level 3 : Conditional Automation**

<p align='justify'> The driver may delegate the driving on the two guiding dimensions (longitudinal and lateral) and can lower his level of vigilance to focus briefly on other tasks. The intelligent steering system then takes care of positioning and maintaining the vehicle on its way while maintaining a rhythm adapted to the speed and traffic conditions. The driver must remain able to regain control of the operation if the conditions require it. </p>

**Level 4 : High Automation**

<p align='justify'> The driver no longer intervenes and can indeed completely divert his attention to do something else. On the other hand, this level concerns only certain driving modes and under certain conditions. It is the driver who activates and deactivates the automated mode. </p>

**Level 5 : Complete Automation**

<p align='justify'> The human being does not intervene any more neither in the control nor in the supervision of the task of driving. Everything is under the responsibility and control of the system. The presence of a human being at the controls is no longer necessary. Letâ€™s see the video in the link below that describe the 6 levels of autonomy with
an example of BMW autonomous cars. </p>
